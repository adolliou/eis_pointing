  Three consecutive steps.
  1) Correct an average translation (up to the raster field of view).
  2) Simultaneously correct a rotation (between -3 and 3°), and a smaller
     translation (-10 to 10 arcsec along X, and -5 to 5 arcsec along Y).
  3) correct the translation for individual slit positions
     (-20, 20 arcsec along each axis).
steps:
  - type: shift
    cc_function: explicit
    cc_boundary: drop
    sub_px: True
  - type: rotshift
    # search for X shifts between -10 and 10 arcsec, computing the
    # cross-correlation at 11 positions
    x_set: OffsetSet((-10, 10), number=11)
    y_set: OffsetSet((-5, 5), number=11)
    # search for angles between -3 and 3°, with a step of 0.2°
    a_set: OffsetSet((-3, 3), step=.2)
